# Getting Started with Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

## Why Jetpack Compose?

- Declarative UI
- Less code
- Powerful tools
- Intuitive Kotlin APIs
- Easy to maintain and update

## Basic Concepts

### Composable Functions
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Text(text = "Hello, $name!")
}
```

### State Management
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    Button(onClick = { count++ }) {
        Text("Count: $count")
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Add dependencies to your build.gradle
2. Create your first composable
3. Preview your UI
4. Handle state and events

## Best Practices

- Keep composables small and focused
- Use proper state management
- Follow Material Design guidelines
- Test your composables

## Conclusion

Jetpack Compose represents the future of Android UI development. Its declarative approach and powerful features make it easier than ever to create beautiful, responsive UIs.
